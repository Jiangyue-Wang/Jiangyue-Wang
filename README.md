## Welcome to Jiangyue's homepage!
I am Jiangyue Wang (王江月). I am a junior major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in School of Life Sciences, Peking University. I will be a senior and also in the first year of phD next semester, thanks for a special "4+4" Program. 
My research fields include biodiversity monitoring, population dynamics of large terrestrial carnivores, functions of apex predators and mechanisms of forest refreshing. Currenty I am working on the population of leopard in Xinlong County, Sichuan Province. Wish me good luck on writing this paper!
