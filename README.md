## Welcome to Jiangyue's homepage!
I am Jiangyue Wang (王江月). I am a first-year PhD student major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in School of Life Sciences, Peking University. 
Currently I am working on large carnivores in western Qilian Mountains, aiming to reveal their seasonal dietary partitioning, space use preferences, and interaction with human-related activities. In the past few months, I am focusing on habitat classification using remote sensing, snow leopard individual identification and population estimation using SCR framework, animal movement modeling, and pheasant habitat contraction and recovery during last ten years due to the presence and removal of free-ranging livestock. If you are interested in my research projects, I am willing to have a chat!
