## Welcome to Jiangyue's homepage!
I am Jiangyue Wang (王江月), currently a first-year graduate student of the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM) program at University of Washington, Seattle.

My research is centered around the study of large carnivores, with a particular focus on understanding their movement patterns, seasonal dietary preferences, spatial utilization patterns, and interactions with human-related activities. Currently, I work on estimating cougar mortality risks along movement tracks. I am also playing around with Parallel SnowModel and potentially will explore cougar-snow interactions.

If you share an interest in any of these research or simply wish to connect and discuss, I am eager to engage in conversations. Please feel free to reach out!
